## Barnes-Hut
## THE GRAVITATIONAL N-BODY PROBLEM 
The goal of the assignment is to implement the Barnes-Hut algorithm in C to reduce the calculations required for simulating the N-body problem. 
The exact solution to the problem has an O(N^2) complexity for N amount of particles, ergo, the code quickly becomes slow for an increasing size of the problem. 
In this assignment, the performance and the complexity of the Barnes-Hut algorithm will be examined and compared to the exact way of solving the N-body problem.
Additionally, the algorithm were parallelized using Pthreads.
